This is how I got it to work as the readme file in here is crap!!


Before starting I had to install these programs.
Install them as root, using "su" command.


apt-remove git
apt-get install git
apt-get install make
apt-get install gcc
apt-get install u-boot-tools

After you have made the directories according to the readme file you can use this command
to copy the extracted files into the newly made directories

sudo nautilus used to open file manager as root to copy files
Copy files to root/fastbot

After you used git to get repository you need to make two changes to build.sh as that file contains errors.


change build.sh
-remove extra dash at firmware (line 110)
-remoce extra dash at && (line 242)

before executing ./build.sh init you need to excute git init

./build.sh init executed in tools folder
